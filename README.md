Arch-Retro-Gaming-System (Arch-RGS) is a retro gaming platform based on RetroPie for Arch Linux based systems. Currently only x86_64 architecture supported.

All credit goes to the RetroPie Project team and the numerous contributers to the Retropie Project.
I must add that I am not affiliated with the RetroPie Project and any errors are purely my own.

Thanks also goes to all the software maintainers and contributers to Arch Linux.

Clone this repo via git clone https://gitlab.com/arch-rgs/arch-rgs.git, then cd to the arch-rgs directory and run sudo ./archrgs-setup.sh.
You will be presented with a dialog screen in your default virtual terminal. Go to Manage Packages and then run install core packages.
Once the packages have been compiled and installed you will have RetroArch and EmulationStation installed.
To install emulators and libretrocores please go to their respective menus.

I have a few more tasks to complete before I tag the first stable release. It is however in a usable state but there will be bugs/missing features, please report them to me on gitlab.

Thanks.
